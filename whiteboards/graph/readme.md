# Graphs

> Graphs are a super interesting and versatile data structure used in computer science to model and solve real-world problems. Basically, a graph is a collection of nodes or vertices that are connected by edges, which can be either directed or undirected, and weighted or unweighted. The most common way to represent a graph is through an adjacency list, where each node is associated with a list of its neighbors. Different algorithms like DFS and BFS can be used to traverse graphs and find information, while weighted graphs are used for more complex algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm. Graphs are an important and fascinating tool in computer science that can be used to tackle a wide variety of problems.
