# Max Tree
<br>

This one utilized a simple recursive and comparative function where max value was assessed on each branch then returned.

>Start at the root node of the tree.

>Compare the value of the current node with the maximum value found so far.

>If the current node has a left child, traverse the left subtree by making the left child the new current node.

>If the current node does not have a left child or if you have already traversed the left subtree, traverse the right subtree by making the right child the new current node.

>Repeat the process from step 2 until you have visited all the nodes in the tree.
