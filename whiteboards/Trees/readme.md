# Trees
<br>

For the code in this challenge we have several methods within the class BinaryTree:

> preOrder : This method return the node values in the order of root,left,right.
> inOrder : This method returns the node values in the order of left, root, right.
> postOrder : This method returns the node values in the order of left, right root

The BST class extends BinaryTree and uses it in two additional methods:

> add : This method takes a value as an argument and inserts it into the correct position in the tree to maintain the binacy search tree property.
>contains : This method takes a value as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the value is present in the tree.
